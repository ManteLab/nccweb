                        While our models of neural computation are mostly based on neural activity recorded in
                        laboratory settings, they should ultimately also explain brain function during rich natural
                        behaviors. To establish this link, we aim to record neural activity in the same animals both in
                        the laboratory and in natural settings. Quantifying and understanding natural behaviors,
                        however, is a challenge on its own. To tackle this challenge, we develop both non-parametric and
                        model-based approaches to infer the structure and dynamics in dense, high-dimensional behavioral
                        data. In one line of research we study how the developing song a of juvenile bird changes over
                        the course of many months of training. Song development is a powerful model of motor learning
                        during a complex, natural behavior, which can conveniently be recorded with just a microphone.
                        In another line of research, we use continuous video recordings to study individual and social
                        behaviors in a group of monkeys living in a zoo-like enclosure. Extracting the relevant behavior
                        from videos is hard, and requires state-of-the art approaches from computer vision and
                        machine-learning.
