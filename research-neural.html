                        Our past work lends support to the hypothesis of “computation-through-dynamics”, the idea that
                        computations in the brain emerge from and are best understood at the level of collective
                        dynamics of large neural populations. We characterize and model neural population dynamics with
                        a variety of tools, including decoding approaches, fits of linear and non-linear dynamical
                        systems, and deep neural networks trained both with supervised and unsupervised
                        (reinforcement-learning) methods. Reverse-engineering of the trained networks provides novel
                        hypotheses about the nature of neural computations in the brain. We focus predominantly on
                        understanding computations underlying cognitive abilities like long-term planning, inhibitory
                        control, and attention. These abilities are thought to rely critically on a network of areas in
                        prefrontal cortex. The great majority of these areas exist only in primates, which is why we
                        study macaques. Ultimately our models of computations should be precise enough to predict the
                        neural and behavioral consequences of arbitrary causal perturbations of the population activity,
                        and explain the mechanism underlying cognitive deficits akin to those observed in psychiatric
                        disorders.
