                        Research in the Mante lab aims to uncover how complex cognitive abilities, such as reasoning,
                        problem-solving, and decision-making, emerge from the coordinated activity of neural populations
                        distributed across brain-wide networks. We take an interdisciplinary approach that integrates
                        behavioral and neurophysiological experiments in humans and monkeys with computational methods,
                        including machine learning for analyzing large-scale behavioral and neural datasets and
                        artificial intelligence for modeling these datasets and generating hypotheses about the neural
                        computations underlying cognition. Beyond studying cognition in neurotypical humans and monkeys,
                        we seek to understand how disruptions in these neural computations contribute to cognitive
                        deficits in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In parallel, we develop novel analytical
                        approaches for high-dimensional datasets, advancing data science in neuroscience and related
                        fields.

                                Advances in experimental methodologies in neuroscience lead to ever-larger behavioral
                                and
                                neural
                                data sets. Such data is highly structured, but describing this structure quantitatively
                                is
                                typically very challenging. Most often we lack good models of natural behavior or neural
                                computations that could point to the most relevant aspects of the data. One focus of the
                                lab
                                is
                                to develop generally applicable methods that can reveal the structure in large datasets
                                without
                                strong assumptions about the properties of the underlying data. We recently introduced
                                non-parametric approaches based on nearest-neighbor statistics to reveal the topology of
                                dense,
                                high-dimensional data. These approaches make only weak assumptions about the nature of
                                the
                                data
                                (e.g. clustering) and are thus broadly applicable. Together with more traditional
                                Targeted
                                Dimensionality Reduction techniques, these methods can provide quantitative, unbiased
                                descriptions of the structure of high-dimensional behavioral and neural data.

                                Decision-making paradigms are used in basic and clinical research to reveal the
                                processes underlying normal and impaired cognition. Mechanistic models of behavior play
                                a key role in interpreting the choices of participants in these tasks. For one, they
                                can reveal how perceptual processes interact with cognitive processes like attention,
                                impulsivity, or biases to form a choice. For another, they provide access to latent
                                variables (like the momentary belief or confidence of the participant) that may be
                                more tightly linked to the underlying neural processes than the observed choices. We
                                combine approaches from Bayesian inference, stochastic differential models, and a lot
                                of computational power to evaluate hundreds of models on the behavior of individual
                                participants (humans or macaques). This approach leads to a fine-grained
                                characterization of the latent decision processes in each individual, but also reveal
                                considerable differences across individuals. The resulting quantitative descriptions of
                                behavior form the basis of analyses of concurrently measured neural activity and could
                                provide new insights into the nature of cognitive deficits in psychiatric and
                                neurological disorders.

                                Our past work lends support to the hypothesis of "computation-through-dynamics", the
                                idea
                                that
                                computations in the brain emerge from and are best understood at the level of collective
                                dynamics of large neural populations. We characterize and model neural population
                                dynamics
                                with
                                a variety of tools, including decoding approaches, fits of linear and non-linear

                                systems, and deep neural networks trained both with supervised and unsupervised
                                (reinforcement-learning) methods. Reverse-engineering of the trained networks provides
                                novel
                                hypotheses about the nature of neural computations in the brain. We focus predominantly
                                on
                                understanding computations underlying cognitive abilities like long-term planning,
                                inhibitory
                                control, and attention. These abilities are thought to rely critically on a network of
                                areas
                                in
                                prefrontal cortex. The great majority of these areas exist only in primates, which is
                                why

                                study macaques. Ultimately our models of computations should be precise enough to
                                predict
                                the

                                While our models of neural computation are mostly based on neural activity recorded in
                                laboratory settings, they should ultimately also explain brain function during rich
                                natural
                                behaviors. To establish this link, we aim to record neural activity in the same animals
                                both
                                in
                                the laboratory and in natural settings. Quantifying and understanding natural behaviors,
                                however, is a challenge on its own. To tackle this challenge, we develop both
                                non-parametric
                                and
                                model-based approaches to infer the structure and dynamics in dense, high-dimensional
                                behavioral
                                data. In one line of research we study how the developing song a of juvenile bird
                                changes
                                over
                                the course of many months of training. Song development is a powerful model of motor
                                learning
                                during a complex, natural behavior, which can conveniently be recorded with just a
                                microphone.
                                In another line of research, we use continuous video recordings to study individual and
                                social
                                behaviors in a group of monkeys living in a zoo-like enclosure. Extracting the relevant
                                behavior
                                from videos is hard, and requires state-of-the art approaches from computer vision and
                                machine-learning.
