                        Research in the Mante lab aims to uncover how complex cognitive abilities, such as reasoning,
                        problem-solving, and decision-making, emerge from the coordinated activity of neural populations
                        distributed across brain-wide networks. We take an interdisciplinary approach that integrates
                        behavioral and neurophysiological experiments in humans and monkeys with computational methods,
                        including machine learning for analyzing large-scale behavioral and neural datasets and
                        artificial intelligence for modeling these datasets and generating hypotheses about the neural
                        computations underlying cognition. Beyond studying cognition in neurotypical humans and monkeys,
                        we seek to understand how disruptions in these neural computations contribute to cognitive
                        deficits in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In parallel, we develop novel analytical
                        approaches for high-dimensional datasets, advancing data science in neuroscience and related
                        fields.

                            Advances in experimental methodologies in neuroscience lead to ever-larger behavioral and neural
                            data sets. Such data is highly structured, but describing this structure quantitatively is
                            typically very challenging. Most often we lack good models of natural behavior or neural
                            computations that could point to the most relevant aspects of the data. One focus of the lab is
                            to develop generally applicable methods that can reveal the structure in large datasets without
                            strong assumptions about the properties of the underlying data. We recently introduced
                            non-parametric approaches based on nearest-neighbor statistics to reveal the topology of dense,
                            high-dimensional data. These approaches make only weak assumptions about the nature of the data
                            (e.g. clustering) and are thus broadly applicable. Together with more traditional Targeted
                            Dimensionality Reduction techniques, these methods can provide quantitative, unbiased
                            descriptions of the structure of high-dimensional behavioral and neural data.

                        <p class="hero-description">
                            Decision-making paradigms are used in basic and clinical research to reveal the processes
                            underlying normal and impaired cognition. Mechanistic models of behavior play a key role in
                            interpreting the choices of participants in these tasks. For one, they can reveal how perceptual
                            processes interact with cognitive processes like attention, impulsivity, or biases to form a
                            choice. For another, they provide access to latent variables (like the momentary belief or
                            confidence of the participant) that may be more tightly linked to the underlying neural
                            processes than the observed choices. We combine approaches from Bayesian inference, stochastic
                            differential models, and a lot of computational power to evaluate hundreds of models on the
                            behavior of individual participants (humans or macaques). This approach leads to a fine-grained
                            characterization of the latent decision processes in each individual, but also reveal
                            considerable differences across individuals. The resulting quantitative descriptions of behavior
                            form the basis of analyses of concurrently measured neural activity and could provide new
                            insights into the nature of cognitive deficits in psychiatric and neurological disorders.

                            Our past work lends support to the hypothesis of "computation-through-dynamics", the idea that
                            computations in the brain emerge from and are best understood at the level of collective
                            dynamics of large neural populations. We characterize and model neural population dynamics with
                            a variety of tools, including decoding approaches, fits of linear and non-linear dynamical
                            systems, and deep neural networks trained both with supervised and unsupervised
                            (reinforcement-learning) methods. Reverse-engineering of the trained networks provides novel
                            hypotheses about the nature of neural computations in the brain. We focus predominantly on
                            understanding computations underlying cognitive abilities like long-term planning, inhibitory
                            control, and attention. These abilities are thought to rely critically on a network of areas in
                            prefrontal cortex. The great majority of these areas exist only in primates, which is why we
                            study macaques. Ultimately our models of computations should be precise enough to predict the
                            neural and behavioral consequences of arbitrary causal perturbations of the population activity,
                            and explain the mechanism underlying cognitive deficits akin to those observed in psychiatric
                            disorders.

                        <p class="hero-description">
                            While our models of neural computation are mostly based on neural activity recorded in
                            laboratory settings, they should ultimately also explain brain function during rich natural
                            behaviors. To establish this link, we aim to record neural activity in the same animals both in
                            the laboratory and in natural settings. Quantifying and understanding natural behaviors,
                            however, is a challenge on its own. To tackle this challenge, we develop both non-parametric and
                            model-based approaches to infer the structure and dynamics in dense, high-dimensional behavioral
                            data. In one line of research we study how the developing song a of juvenile bird changes over
                            the course of many months of training. Song development is a powerful model of motor learning
                            during a complex, natural behavior, which can conveniently be recorded with just a microphone.
                            In another line of research, we use continuous video recordings to study individual and social
                            behaviors in a group of monkeys living in a zoo-like enclosure. Extracting the relevant behavior
                            from videos is hard, and requires state-of-the art approaches from computer vision and
                            machine-learning.
