                        Advances in experimental methodologies in neuroscience lead to ever-larger behavioral and neural
                        data sets. Such data is highly structured, but describing this structure quantitatively is
                        typically very challenging. Most often we lack good models of natural behavior or neural
                        computations that could point to the most relevant aspects of the data. One focus of the lab is
                        to develop generally applicable methods that can reveal the structure in large datasets without
                        strong assumptions about the properties of the underlying data. We recently introduced
                        non-parametric approaches based on nearest-neighbor statistics to reveal the topology of dense,
                        high-dimensional data. These approaches make only weak assumptions about the nature of the data
                        (e.g. clustering) and are thus broadly applicable. Together with more traditional Targeted
                        Dimensionality Reduction techniques, these methods can provide quantitative, unbiased
                        descriptions of the structure of high-dimensional behavioral and neural data.
